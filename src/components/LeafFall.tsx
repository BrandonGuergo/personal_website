/**
 * Falling leaves for the photography section, drawn as a vintage colour print.
 *
 * The look is the point: leaves are not painted as flat silhouettes but screened
 * like ink on paper. Each colour gets its own halftone tile — a dot on a small
 * grid — and every leaf is filled twice, once with a faint flat wash for body
 * and once through that tile for texture. The tiles are pinned to the page
 * rather than to the leaf (`pattern.setTransform`), because a printing screen
 * belongs to the sheet: dots do not tumble with the thing they describe. Each
 * colour's screen also sits at its own angle, the way real plates are rotated
 * off each other to avoid moiré.
 *
 * The nearest leaves print a second time in a lighter green, offset a pixel or
 * so, as a deliberately misregistered plate. It keeps the vintage-print feel
 * without taking the leaves out of their green palette.
 *
 * Motion is continuous rather than stepped. A leaf falls at its own rate, sways
 * on a sine, and flutters: `flip` scales it horizontally through zero so it
 * reads as turning edge-on and back, which is most of what sells a real leaf
 * from a rotating shape. Three depth layers differ in size, speed and ink
 * weight, so the field has front and back instead of one flat plane.
 *
 * Standing in the scene is a pixel tree, in the flat-pad silhouette of a garden
 * pine. It is grown once on a coarse cell grid and drawn as whole cells only,
 * and it does not move: a pixel sprite that slides by fractions of a cell stops
 * reading as pixel art, and stepping it whole cells reads as a glitch, so the
 * tree stays put and the air around it does the moving. Some of the field's
 * leaves let go from the undersides of its pads (`Tree.spawns`) rather than
 * drifting in from above, which is what ties the fall to the tree.
 *
 * It is rooted on the `anchor` element's bottom edge rather than on the section's
 * — at the foot of the section the photo grid simply covers it. Given the
 * heading's rule to stand on, the tree grows up into the clear band beside the
 * title, and its leaves then have the whole section to fall through. Its height
 * is whatever that band affords. Without an anchor it falls back to standing at
 * the bottom left.
 *
 * A small pixel bird shares the air with the leaves. It cruises the section on
 * a swooping wander — steering toward a drifting target rather than following a
 * path, so no two circuits repeat — and every so often it banks down to a twig
 * nest built into the crook of one of the tree's branches, folds its wings, and
 * sits a while before taking off again. The nest is part of the tree's own
 * cells, so it is always there; only the bird comes and goes. While perched the
 * bird snaps to the tree's pixel grid, for the same reason the tree itself
 * never moves by fractions of a cell.
 *
 * Faint ink-like wind curls surface here and there behind the leaves. Each is
 * one stroke that draws itself on along its own spine — a long undulating
 * approach ending in a loop that spirals inward — with only a stretch of the
 * spine visible at a time. The travel of that stretch is the swirl; the mark
 * itself barely moves.
 *
 * Everything is aria-hidden decoration behind the photo grid. It animates only
 * while the section is on screen and the tab is visible, and reduced motion
 * gets a single still frame of a settled field rather than a blank canvas.
